Programme VBA Excel 2021 - Bac 1 HELha

This excel file contains a large VBA program with GUI and uses sheets as database.
The program was a project I was tasked to do in my first year at the HELha Mons in my management computing bachelor.
The "client" was the school itself, and the best program would be selected to be really used there.
This was my take on it, and it ended up being selected in the "finale".
The selected programs were supposed to be presented in front of the direction of the HELha, but with the covid it was cancelled.
I was asked to present it in front of the 1st year bachelor students the following year to "show them what they can learn to achieve at HELha".

On the personal side, this was my first real programmation project I had after 3 years of computer science in high school.
It took me about a week to make it all work, and then a couple days to polish.
